## AOE2-DE-Unofficial-Patch - by SirSgtCire
Welcome to the Unofficial Patch Definitive Edition, Version 1.7!

This mod is kept up to date with the latest patches from DE, as I always try to incorporate dev changes into my work. 
Therefore this mod currently operates on patch: 40220

This mod contains changes that, in a completely subjective context, improve gameplay for some civs and restore some 
unecessarily lost power to others. The goal of these changes is to improve the historical accuracy of some civs, 
while at the same time ensuring balance for civs who aren't getting the same attention. My goal with this mod 
is to see how far I can balance the game while at the same time keeping crown techs unique.
