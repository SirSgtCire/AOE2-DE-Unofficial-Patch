## AOE2-DE-Unofficial-Patch - by SirSgtCire
Welcome to the Unofficial Patch Definitive Edition, Version 2.3!

This mod is kept up to date with the latest patches from DE, as I always try to incorporate approved dev changes into my work. 
Therefore this mod currently operates on patch: 46295

This mod is taking a different approach to balancing the game. There are some situations in which the devs 
nerfed or buffed certain techs or units, either for the wrong reasons or completely unnecessarily. My goal 
with this mod is to focus on historical accuracy (as much as is possible in this game, without doing a 
complete overhaul), diverse strategies, unique playstyles for certain civs (not every civ should be able 
to do everything well), and focusing more on the usefulness of unique techs and unique units.
