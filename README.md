## AOE2-DE-Unofficial-Patch - by SirSgtCire
Welcome to the Unofficial Patch Definitive Edition, Version 1.2!

This mod is the evolution of my original HD mod of the same name, which can be found here: 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1521292652&searchtext=unofficial

This mod contains changes that, in a completely subjective context, improve gameplay for some civs and restore some 
unecessarily lost power to others. The goal of these changes is to improve the historical accuracy of some civs, 
while at the same time ensuring balance for civs who aren't getting the same attention.

There are differences between the HD version and this version, as the balance scene has changed 
with the addition of the four new civs in DE. 

The following changes are things that need experimentation, to see if they will work in DE:

- add in combat stances to Villagers (helps Spanish and Inca villagers immensely) - RESEARCHING
- implement GAIA regeneration in trees, berry bushes, killable animals and fish - RESEARCHING
- have Villagers drop their collected resources on death, in the form of barrels - RESEARCHING
- make Farms 2x2 instead of 3x3 - RESEARCHING
