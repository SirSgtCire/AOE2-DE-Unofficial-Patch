## AOE2-DE-Unofficial-Patch - by SirSgtCire
Welcome to the Unofficial Patch Definitive Edition, Version 1.6!

This mod is kept up to date with the latest patches from DE, as I always try to incorporate dev changes into my work. 
Therefore this mod operates on patch: 37650

This mod contains changes that, in a completely subjective context, improve gameplay for some civs and restore some 
unecessarily lost power to others. The goal of these changes is to improve the historical accuracy of some civs, 
while at the same time ensuring balance for civs who aren't getting the same attention. My goal with this mod 
is to see how far I can balance the game while at the same time keeping unique techs very unique and different.

The following changes are things that need experimentation, to see if they will work in DE:

- add in combat stances to Villagers (helps Spanish and Inca villagers immensely) - RESEARCHING
- implement GAIA regeneration in trees, berry bushes, killable animals and fish - RESEARCHING
- have Villagers drop their collected resources on death, in the form of barrels and crates - RESEARCHING
