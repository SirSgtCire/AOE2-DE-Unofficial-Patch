## AOE2-DE-Unofficial-Patch - by SirSgtCire
Welcome to the Unofficial Patch Definitive Edition, Version 3.2!

This mod is kept up to date with the latest patches from DE, as I always try to incorporate approved dev changes into my work. 
Therefore this mod currently operates on patch: 56005

My goal with this mod is to focus on diverse strategies, unique playstyles for certain civs (not every civ should 
be able to do everything well), some historical accuracy (as much as is possible in this game, without 
doing a complete overhaul), and focusing more on the usefulness of unique techs and unique units.

I also want to acknowledge when the devs do make important balance decisions (like adjusting the movement speed 
of a unit or changing the way a unique tech works for a particular civ) that are beneficial to the health and 
longevity of the game, and want to do my best to keep some of those changes, and even incorporate some of those 
design decisions into my own ideas for balance.
